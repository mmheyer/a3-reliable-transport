EECS 497:  Major Design Projects
Testing and Debugging Report
This assignment consists of 3 parts:

Sample Test Suite
Bug Reports
Testing and Debugging Summary

Assignment Background & Context
Testing and debugging code is arguably one of the most important, and yet, most overlooked steps in software development.  Months or years of development can be wasted if this process is not done properly or does not result in a functional product.  Therefore, this assignment is designed to help you identify a set of tests on which to run your software prior to its release and also generate a series of bug reports that detail what parts of your software were, or remain to be, fixed in the process.

Sample Test Suite
For this part of the assignment, you must submit a minimum of 10 test descriptions using the form found in Appendix A of this assignment.  It is expected that these tests will not represent the totality of the tests that you have and/or will be using to test your project.  Therefore, do your best to include as diverse a set of tests as possible.  In other words, do not submit only a collection of unit tests or a collection of systems tests.  Instead, try to include several tests of each type.  Finally, we are not looking to see test code per se since we are looking for high-level descriptions of your tests.  You can include code if you like, but it won't mean much to us.

Bug Reports
For this part of this assignment, you must submit a minimum of 10 bug reports using the form found in Appendix B of this assignment.  These reports may either be for bugs identified by the negative outcome(s) of running the tests in the first part of this assignment or bugs that were found using other means.  Note that it is not expected that the bugs identified in these reports have been resolved.

Testing and Debugging Summary
For the final part of this assignment, you must submit a one-page (maximum) summary that describes your overall reasoning for picking the tests that were included in the first part of this assignment.  In addition, discuss what your plans are to address any bugs that are currently unresolved and what final tests you plan on running prior to the completion of your project.
